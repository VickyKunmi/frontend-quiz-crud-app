# Frontend Developer Quiz: React + Redux CRUD App

This is a vite + React project 

## Why Vite instead of create-react-app (CRA)?
Base on the instructions provided in the email "Build a CRUD app using React and Redux."-the required libary for this project is React.However, at the time of the development, the create-react-app (CRA) has been deprecated and was no longer actively mantained. 
The react team recommends using vite or Next.js. For this project, I chose vite.

### instructions for running the app locally
1. clone the repository
"git clone https://github.com/VickyKunmi/frontend-quiz-crud-app.git"

2. Navigate to the project directory
"cd frontend-quiz-crud-app"

3. Install dependencies
"npm install"

4. Start the development Server
"npm run dev"

#### The app will start at http://localhost:5173/ (the default vite port)
